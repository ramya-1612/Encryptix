# Definition
A personal portfolio website is an online platform where an individual showcases their skills, work, and experience. Typically built using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for structuring content and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout, a portfolio serves as a digital resume or gallery, providing a comprehensive overview of an individual's professional abilities. It is especially useful for designers, developers, artists, and other creative professionals to present their work to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. By organizing content into distinct sections—such as a header, about, skills, projects, resume, and contact—a personal portfolio effectively communicates the creator's brand and expertise.
