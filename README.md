It is especially useful for designers, developers, artists, and other creative professionals to present their work to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. By organizing content into distinct sections—such as a header, about, skills, projects, resume, and contact—a personal portfolio effectively communicates the creator's brand and expertise.
